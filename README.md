Install the latest Node.js LTS
Run dotnet new --install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template to install the project template
Create a folder for your solution and cd into it (the template will use it as project name)
Run dotnet new ca-sln to create a new project
Navigate to src/API and launch the project using dotnet run
